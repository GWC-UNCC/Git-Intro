## Add a file

If you click on the add file icon in the file explorer section, on the left hand side, then you can add a file to the repository.

![add file](/pictures/basics/img00.png)

You can name it anything, but remember to give it an extention ( i.e. `.txt` for text files ). Then hit `Enter` when you finish naming it. This will open it as the file you are editing.

![name file](/pictures/basics/img01.png)

Once you add some text to the file, go to `File` ‚û°Ô∏è `Save` ( now just known as `save`)

![save file](/pictures/basics/img02.png)

## Check on your file

You should notice now that the file's name now looks green, there is no more ‚ö™ next to the name, and it has a `U` next to it's name.
As well as on the far left hand side there is now a 1 that has popped up.

![saved file](/pictures/basics/img03.png)

Click on the icon with a 1 on it, and this will bring you to the "Source Control" view.
Here you should see your file which you just created under a section called "Changes".
The `U` stands for untracked changes, so that means while you added your file to folder the repo is in git isn't tracking your changes to it yet.

## Commit your file

Now we are going to commit this file, so that git will track you changes ( also allowing other to access it, since git will hold on to it ).
Click on the `+` next to the `U` under the "Changes" section.

![commit file](/pictures/basics/img05.png)

You will now notice that your file has an `A` next to it now, and instead of under the changes section your file is under the "Staged Changes" section.
The `A` means that your changes are staged and you are adding something.

![staged file](/pictures/basics/img06.png)

Now you are going to add some text in the Message box right above the "Staged Changes" section.
This text will be tied to your changes as a commit message.
You want make this message as descriptive as possible, because this is your log for the different changes you have made to files ( your future self/teammates will thank you üòÅ ).

![commit message](/pictures/basics/img07.png)

When you are done, hit `Ctrl`+`Enter`.
Then you will get an error pop-up.
Click on the "Open Git Log" button.

![commit message](/pictures/basics/img08.png)

Click on the "TERMINAL" menu from the bottom pop-up.

![commit message](/pictures/basics/img09.png)

Type the following in your terminal* ( substitute <> with your information ):

```shell
git config --global user.email "<your_email>"
git config --global user.name "<your Github username>"
```

\* - you can normally launch your terminal by going to the `Terminal` menu option up top and clicking the `New Terminal` option.

Now go back to your commit message, and when you press `Ctrl`+`Enter` now it should be successful.
There should be no more files under the changes section ( img 1 ), but there is a new change to be pushed to the remote repository ( img 2 ).

![no more files](/pictures/basics/img10.png)

![new changes to push](/pictures/basics/img11.png)

Launch your command palette, and type `push` and hit `Enter`.
