## Overview

### What is Git

#### Definition

tl;dr: it is used to help manage, store, and merge your things ( code, files, images, etc... ) with other people.

> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

### What is GitHub

tl;dr: one of the most popular Git hosting websites.

### What is this workshop for?

This workshop will be to help you get up and running with some basic understand and usage of using Git ( refereced as git ) with GitHub ( refereced as github ), through [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ( referenced as vscode ).

Setup instructions are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCzhlfw8hHLdF0ZBhHfcjOAIyA1cO7OnHbG1he1prM0/edit?usp=sharing) if you need them.

While we will use the vscode GUI ( Graphical User Interface ( using your mouse or clicking on things )), to do all of these commands.
<!-- this is an easter egg #1, post in the web team channel if you found me 😁 -->
I would emplore you to eventually, as time permits, understand what these commands are doing behind the scences.
There will be ( at a later date ) a reference at the bottom of each section to show you what the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) ( command line interface ( text you put into a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal#Software) ))

### What is this document?

This document is a [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file ( .md extention ), and is the common format for how you convey information to others on github through various ways ( documentation, pull requests, issues, etc... ).
