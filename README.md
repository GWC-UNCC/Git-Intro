## Overview

### What is Git

#### Definition

src: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

tl;dr: it is used to help manage, store, and merge your things ( code, files, images, etc... ) with other people.

### What is GitHub

src: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

tl;dr: one of the most popular Git hosting websites.

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

### What is this workshop for?

This workshop will be to help you get up and running with some basic understand and usage of using Git ( refereced as git ) with GitHub ( refereced as github ), through [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ( referenced as vscode ).

Setup instructions are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_xeNWd3DUjafba5Dbd-EzAtfL_CfntuS/view?usp=sharing) if you need them.
**NOTE**: you will need to sign-in with your UNC Charlotte email address.

While we will use the vscode GUI ( Graphical User Interface ( using your mouse or clicking on things )), to do all of these commands.
I would emplore you to eventually, as time permits, understand what these commands are doing behind the scences.
There will be a reference at the bottom of each section to show you what the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) ( command line interface ( text you put into a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal#Software) ))
